# React Toolbox
Great implementation and strong knowledge how React works.
Well tested and very well designed (technical speaking).

Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

- [site](http://react-toolbox.com/#/components)



# Ant Design
Great documentation. See how they design their Doc.
Like how they group components - e.g. Data Display.

# Semantic UI
Not specific to React. See how they design their Doc.
Get idea how components are build (classNames and technqiues).

- [site](https://semantic-ui.com/)



# Material UI
Google Material Design UI for React.
Don't agree with how it's build and used.
Just for inspiration of API, naming.

- [Material Design Guildline (reference)](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)




# The Rest - for the sake of completion

- [Elemental UI](http://elemental-ui.com/) by Max Striober.
Like Bootstrap. Not many components. Nothing advanced.
Forms and Spinners sections might be worth checking out.

- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
Not specific to React.
Inspiration of how they name components and parts of them (classnames).
