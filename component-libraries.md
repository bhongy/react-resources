# [React Toolbox](http://react-toolbox.com/#/components)
Great implementation and strong knowledge how React works.
Well tested and very well designed (technical speaking).

Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

<br />

# [Ant Design]((https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce))
Great documentation. See how they design their Doc.
Like how they group components - e.g. Data Display.

<br />

# [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
Not specific to React. See how they design their Doc.
Get idea how components are build (classNames and technqiues).

<br />

# [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)
[Material Design Guildline (reference)](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/introduction.html)

Google Material Design UI for React.
Don't agree with how it's build and used.
Just for inspiration of API, naming.

<br />

# The Rest - for the sake of completion

- [Elemental UI](http://elemental-ui.com/) by Max Striober. Like Bootstrap. Not many components. Forms and Spinners sections might be worth checking out.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) Get inspiration of how they name components and parts of them (classnames).
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)
